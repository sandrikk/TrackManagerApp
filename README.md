# Track Manager App

## Overview
The Track Manager App is a proof of concept application designed to manage and visualize railway networks. It offers various functionalities to analyze and manipulate railway data.

## Features
- **Shortest Route Calculation:** Allows users to determine the shortest route between two stations selected by the user.
- **Minimum Track Connections:** Determines the minimum track connections and total length required to travel between any two stations within a specified rectangular area.
- **Graphical Representation:** Provides graphical representations of the track network, found routes, and minimum spanning trees for enhanced visualization.

## Implementation Details
The Track Manager App is implemented with the following features:

- **Search Algorithms:** Includes binary search and linear list search algorithms for efficient station search by name.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Utilizes selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and mergesort for sorting connections by length.
- **Data Structures:** Employs a Binary Search Tree (preferably an AVL-tree) and a Hash map for efficient storage and retrieval of station data.
- **Minimum Heap:** Implements a general min-heap based on an array for priority-based operations.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine stations falling within a specified rectangular area.
- **Route Calculation:** Determines the shortest route using Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm for efficient route planning.

## Usage
To use the Track Manager App, follow these steps:
1. Install the application on your device.
2. Launch the application and navigate through the user interface.
3. Select the desired functionality from the menu options.
